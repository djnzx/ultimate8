# Java Core Detailed Syllabus

## Lesson 6
- OOP main concepts
  - abstraction: it works, it has a contract, I don't want to know how it works
  - encapsulation: put data and code together into the one box
  - polymorphism: different behavior based on subtyping
  - inheritance
- OOP idea - split declaration, instantiation (object creation) and behavior
- classes / objects / instances
- towards OOP
  - how to make our code OOP
  - steps, entities, structure. thinking in terms of responsibilities
- default values for class fields / members
- equals
- Java Memory Model:
  - all objects in the Heap
  - all static in the class loader area
  - all references to the objects in the stack 
- Streams
  - intro
- Collections
  - intro
- CLASS CODING: zoo
  
## Lesson 7
- CLASS CODING: geometric figures
- constructors: primary, secondary
- interfaces, abstract classes
- Streams
  - basics
- Collections
  - basics
- comparing objects
- equals
- towards lambda and method references (java 8)
  - anonymous classes
  - functional interfaces

  - constructor reference
- internal / nested classes

## Lesson 8
- collections
  - generics in details
  - list: ArrayList, LinkedList
  - set: HashSet, TreeSet
  - map: HashMap, TreeMap
- different types of classes: Structural, POJO, Beans
- comparing objects
- equals, hashcode, contract between equals and hashcode
- mutability / immutability

  - private, protected, public, default (package protected)
  - visibility modification during inheritance
  - multiple inheritance
- getters / setters
